Next Steps:

1. Grab count data from http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxevent.html and use that instead of manipulating the file that has data by state. (ugh so much wasted time)
2. Test with this new data in Analysis_Sandbox (which also has the fixed releases grabber that keeps the movie title data!)
3. If everything is working correctly we can replace analysis with analysis_sandbox. fingers crossed.
