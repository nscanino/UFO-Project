Next Steps:

1. Grab count data from http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxevent.html and use that instead of manipulating the file that has data by state. (ugh so much wasted time)
2. Test with this new data in Analysis_Sandbox (which also has the fixed releases grabber that keeps the movie title data!)
3. If everything is working correctly we can replace analysis with analysis_sandbox. fingers crossed.


NOTES FOR NEW NUFORC SCRAPE:

rows = driver.find_elements(iterate through table?)
Somehow grab table info, may be easier to just use BeautifulSoup?

Helpful:

mytable = find_element_by_css_selector('table.datadisplaytable')
for row in mytable.find_elements_by_css_selector('tr'):
    for cell in row.find_elements_by_tag_name('td'):
        print(cell.text)
